# MatlabProject_Summing_amplifier
This MATLAB project was developed within the Computer-Aided Graphics Laboratory and represents a complex simulation of the behavior of a summing amplifier. Through this project, we have created an interactive interface that offers users a wide range of options for exploring and understanding concepts related to summing amplifiers. The interface includes the following functionalities:

Display Electrical Schematic: A special button allows users to visualize the electrical schematic of the summing amplifier, enabling them to study the connections and components involved in detail.

Select Standard Resistors: Users can choose standard resistors for configuring the summing amplifier, providing flexibility in adjusting system parameters.

Choose Various Input Signals: The project allows users to select different types of input signals, such as continuous, sinusoidal, square, triangular, and sawtooth signals. This functionality permits testing the amplifier under various conditions.

Input Custom Values: Users have the option to input customized values for amplitude, frequency, and other relevant parameters, enabling the personalization of experiments and results.

Calculate Input and Output Signals: The project performs complex calculations for the input and output signals of the summing amplifier, allowing users to analyze and compare results based on different input parameters.

This project not only demonstrates my MATLAB programming skills but also my ability to create an interactive and informative interface for exploring electrical engineering concepts. It serves as an excellent example of applying theory to practice and can be used for learning and experimenting with summing amplifiers in an interactive and efficient manner.
